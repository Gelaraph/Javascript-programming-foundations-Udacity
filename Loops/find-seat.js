/*
 * Programming Quiz: Find my Seat
 * 
 * Write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.
 * The first row-seat combination should be 0-0 
 * The last row-seat combination will be 25-99
 * 
 * Things to note: 
 *  - the row and seat numbers start at 0, not 1
 *  - the highest seat number is 99, not 100
 */


let row = 0;  // initial value of the row
let seat = 0; // initial value of the seat within a row

// One loop inside another is called Nested loop.
// Outer `for` loop, to iterate over the rows
for (row = 0; row <= 25; row++){

    // Inner `for` loop, to iterate over the seats within a row
    // In this loop, the value of `row` variable would change only after 100 iterations
    for(seat = 0; seat <= 99; seat++){
        console.log(row+"-"+seat);
    }
